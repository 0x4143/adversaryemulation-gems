# AdversaryEmulation-Gems:

## NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS! (Updated 19 July 2022)


### What's this all about?
This page contains a combination of resources for all things relating to adversary emulation, purple teaming, breach and attack simulation, threat emulation, security control validation, and <insert newer buzz words here>. Note that this page intentionally excludes all the various tools used by red teamers or pen testers, to streamline this page as much as possible. Also, there are other pages out there dedicated to various tools used in the field, so I encourage you to check them out! 


### Who is this page aimed at?
Anyone who has an interest in this space. There aren't a great deal of resources out there as this is a new and upcoming field which is still evolving, which is why I wanted to produce this list of resources which I hope you find useful. 


### Anything else?
If you have any feedback or would like your site listed, feel free to reach out via Twitter.

###### Disclaimer: 
* Full credits/props/respect to all the respective authors for their content.
* I suspect that this list may morph gradually over time to possibly include other infosec related tools/links that aren't directly related to malware or RE, but I will try my very best to stay on topic!  =)
* The links contained in each section are currently in no particular order. 
* I may clean up the order at some point e.g. alphabetize, or order by preference. 
* Some tools/links may likely be in the wrong category, I will review this as time goes on. 
* This is a work-in-progress so bare with me! 
* Sharing is caring, so feel free to forward this link around. 
* "Haters gonna hate"!
* And last but not least, **enjoy! =)
